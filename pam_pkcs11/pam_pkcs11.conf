    # Which slot to use?
    # You can use "slot_num" or "slot_description", but not both, to specify
    # the slot to use.   Using "slot_description" is preferred because the
    # PKCS#11 specification does not guarantee slot ordering. "slot_num" should
    # only be used with those PKCS#11 implementations that guarantee
    # constant slot numbering.
    #
    #  slot_description = "xxxx"
    #      The slot is specified by the slot description, for example, 
    #      slot_description = "Sun Crypto Softtoken".  The default value is
    #      "none" which means to use the first slot with an available token.
    #
    #  slot_num = a_number
    #      The slot is specified by the slot number, for example, slot_num = 1.
    #      The default value is zero which means to use the first slot with an
    #      available token.
    #
    slot_description = "none";

    # Where are CA certificates stored?
    # You can setup this value to:
    # 1- A directory with openssl hash-links to all certificates
    # 2- A CA file in PEM (.pem) or ASN1 (.cer) format,
    # containing all allowed CA certs
    # The default value is /etc/pam_pkcs11/cacerts.
    ca_dir = /etc/pam_pkcs11/cacerts/ca.pem;

    # Path to the directory where the local (offline) CRLs are stored.
    # Same convention as above is applied: you can choose either
    # hash-link directory or CRL file
    # The default value is /etc/pam_pkcs11/crls.

    support_threads = false;

    # Sets the Certificate verification policy. 
    # "none"        Performs no verification
    # "ca"          Does CA check
    # "crl_online"  Downloads the CRL form the location given by the
    #               CRL distribution point extension of the certificate
    # "crl_offline" Uses the locally stored CRLs
    # "crl_auto"    Is a combination of online and offline; it first 
    #               tries to download the CRL from a possibly given CRL 
    #               distribution point and if this fails, uses the local
    #               CRLs
    # "signature"   Does also a signature check to ensure that private
    #               and public key matches
    # You can use a combination of ca,crl, and signature flags, or just
    # use "none".

    # What kind of token?
    # The value of the token_type parameter will be used in the user prompt
    # messages.   The default value is "Smart card".
    token_type = "Smart card";

  # Which mappers ( Cert to login ) to use?
  # you can use several mappers:
  #
  # subject - Cert Subject to login file based mapper
  # pwent   - CN to getpwent() login or gecos fields mapper
  # ldap    - LDAP mapper
  # opensc  - Search certificate in ${HOME}/.eid/authorized_certificates
  # openssh - Search certificate public key in ${HOME}/.ssh/authorized_keys
  # mail    - Compare email fields from certificate
  # ms      - Use Microsoft Universal Principal Name extension
  # krb     - Compare againts Kerberos Principal Name
  # cn      - Compare Common Name (CN)
  # uid     - Compare Unique Identifier
  # digest  - Certificate digest to login (mapfile based) mapper
  # generic - User defined certificate contents mapped
  # null    - blind access/deny mapper
  #
  # You can select a comma-separated mapper list.
  # If used null mapper should be the last in the list :-)
  # Also you should select at least one mapper, otherwise
  # certificate will not match :-)
